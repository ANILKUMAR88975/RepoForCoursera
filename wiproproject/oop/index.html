<h1>Object Oriented Programming through C++</h1>
<pre>I  Year – I SEMESTER							
	<h2 style="text-align:center;">OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING THROUGH C++</h2>	

<h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3> 
•	This course is designed to provide a comprehensive study of the C programming language.  It stresses the strengths of C, which provide students with the means of writing efficient, maintainable and portable code. The nature of C language is emphasized in the wide variety of examples and applications. To learn and acquire art of computer programming. To know about some popular programming languages and how to choose
•	Programming language for solving a problem.


<h3>OUTCOMES:</h3>
•	Understand the basic terminology used in computer programming
•	Write, compile and debug programs in C language. Use different data types in a computer program.
•	Design programs involving decision structures, loops and functions.
•	Explain the difference between call by value and call by reference
